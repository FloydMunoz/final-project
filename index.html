<h3>The California Highway Patrol arrested 14 protesters who chained themselves together in front of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Fair Oaks home, imploring him to release prison inmates and halt transfers from prisons to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.

    CHP officials said the protesters were charged with trespassing and failure to leave, unlawful assembly and failure to disperse after a warning.</h3>
