        <H1>Here are two views on the COVID-19 effects on the incarcerated CDCR population. The first is from a good friend of mine that is curently incarcerated in Tracy D.V.I. The second is of another good friend of mine that was just released August 1st after serving 8 years and his struggle since being released and the hardships he has faced since his release. </H1>

            <P class="kraigsbio"> My name is Kraig Palacio and I will be elaborating on the effects that COVID 19 has had on my life while I was incarcerated, and since my release, I was released from Pelican Bay State Prison on August 1st, 2020 after serving 8 years. In mid-March when the pandemic first began I was incarcerated and the Prison Administration failed to take any safety measures to prevent the Spread of COVID other than putting us all on lockdown only allowing us to come out and use the showers once every three days and not giving us any way to stay clean or disinfect ourselves or our cells besides a bar of soap. So not only were we confined to our 10 by 12 two-man prison cell’s but they stopped all visitation from our families, I was no longer able to see my wife and children who had to drive 447 miles just to see me for a few hours in the first place. We didn’t know what was going on and we were all worried because we were basically just sitting ducks, we had to watch from our cells as COVID spread like wildfire. Then the CDCR Prison Administration took our self-help programs away and basically just stopped making an effort to ensure that they upheld the “R” in CDCR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation which is going to have an adverts effect on the remaining prison population.   

                Since I was released from prison it has been very difficult to obtain an employer due to the pandemic and all the restrictions that have been put in place for our safety in society. It’s already hard for a formerly incarcerated person like me to get a job because of my tattoos and background now with COVID I have no opportunity to get a job and unfortunately with a wife and kids that is not an option.

        <P class= "kraigsbio">My name is Alvin Simmons and I have been in prison since 2015. I am married with 3 children and have a supportive family that is very active in my life. Being together for visits every weekend has allowed me to raise my children the best I could from prison. Then COVID19 came and changed everything. I know there is a stigma about us in prison we have all heard it." He did this to himself." "Don't do the crime if you can't do the time." That's all very true but at the end of the day my heart beats to, I love, I hurt and I miss my family. I say all that to say being in prison locked down with COVID19 is a potential death sentence for me. I have no way to social distance I am forced into small areas with other inmates. The guards do not follow rules and wear masks at all times. I was sentenced to 5 years, not death. To go along with all this I have not held my wife's hand or hugged my children in over 6 months. We are on a modified lockdown and get 2 phone calls for 15 minutes a month. This is stressing my marriage and I can't spend time with my kids. I have 8 months left and I am a nonviolent offender. They are supposed to reduce the prison population but don't see that happening. I will stay positive, I will stay strong, and pray I stay healthy. Thank you for your time and pray for us all in here.
